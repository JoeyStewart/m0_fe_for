# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I actually find for statements to be pretty fun. I do need to work on integrating more of what we learned into the loops. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I felt motivated to find the answers myself. I did take a while to find everything that I needed online but I was proud that 
my research paid off and made challenges 2 and 3 work. I did get an odd error for .length in Challenge 3 that I wasn't able to
solve. The code worked as intended 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to go over my notes and past lessons to understand the functions better. I feel a bit lost when it comes to which one to use.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

All I need is to be more familiar with what I am doing. I do need to understand the purpose of some functions and 
work on the terminology that I should be using.
